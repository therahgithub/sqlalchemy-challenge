# SQLAlchemy Challenge

## Hawaii Weather

Hypothetical Background: In preparation for a trip to Honolulu, I will conduct a climate analysis about the area.

## Analysis & Results

* __Precipitation Analysis__
  * Find the most recent date in the dataset.
  * Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
  * Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.
  * Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names.
  * Sort the DataFrame values by "date".
  * Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method.
  * Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

* __Station Analysis__
  * Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
  * Design a query to find the most-active stations.
  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
  * Which station id has the greatest number of observations?
